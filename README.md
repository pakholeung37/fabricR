## FabricR

**FabricR** is a rewritten repo. Orgin repo: [fabric.js](https://github.com/fabricjs/fabric.js).

> **Fabric.js** is a framework that makes it easy to work with HTML5 canvas element. It is an **interactive object model** on top of canvas element. It is also an **SVG-to-canvas parser**.
>
> Using Fabric.js, you can create and populate objects on canvas; objects like simple geometrical shapes — rectangles, circles, ellipses, polygons, or more complex shapes consisting of hundreds or thousands of simple paths. You can then scale, move, and rotate these objects with the mouse; modify their properties — color, transparency, z-index, etc. You can also manipulate these objects altogether — grouping them with a simple mouse selection.
